The code works with the Cray compiler (tested: Cray C : Version 8.1.4)
and with the GNU compiler (gcc version 4.8.1 20130531 (Cray Inc.)
(GCC)).

The code is roughtly 2 times faster when compiled with GCC. The
hypothesis is that GCC (the 4.8 series) generates superior x86-64
assembly code that contains a significantly lower number of branches.
